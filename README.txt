I have used Arduino IDE version 2.3.2 to upload the code to the board, but you have to adjust the IDE in a way so you can upload the code to the board without any errors. So, please do the following steps:

1. From Arduino IDE, go to **Tools**-**Board**-**Boards manager**
         a. Arduino ESP32 Boards v2.0.13
         b. esp32 v3.0.2 it only works on this version 
         
2. From Arduino IDE, go to **Tools**-**Manage Libraries**
         a. ArduinoHttpClient 0.6.0
         b. Arduino_ESP32_OTA 0.3.0
         c. ESP32 Mail Client 3.4.19
